Look into the campaign contributions to the 2012 presidential elections from TX contributors

```{r}
cont <- read.csv("/Users/danilitovsky/Dropbox/dataScience/Datasets/Campaign_Cont2012-TX.csv")
```

Get summary statistics
```{r}
table(cont$cand_nm) #gives number of contributions to each

#give stats of contributions to each candidate
by(cont$contb_receipt_amt, cont$cand_nm, summary)

#There seem to be a min contribution of negative numbers, so subset these out

cont2 <- subset(cont, contb_receipt_amt > 0)

#run statistics again
by(cont2$contb_receipt_amt, cont2$cand_nm, summary)

#get sense of data
str(cont2)
summary(cont2)
```

Start plotting single variables
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
p1<- ggplot(aes(x= contb_receipt_amt), data = cont2) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,500), breaks= seq(0,500,100)) 


#most contributions are below $150, create a ln version to normalize
cont2$logcontb = log(cont2$contb_receipt_amt)
p2 <- qplot(logcontb, data = cont2)

ggplot(aes(x= contb_receipt_amt), data = cont2) +
  geom_histogram() + scale_x_log10()

#first one logs data and axis, second lots data but leaves axis as raw

#look at cand_nm, contbr_city, contb_employer, contbr_occupation, logcontb, 

#boxplot representing quartiles of contribution
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y= contb_receipt_amt), data = cont2) + geom_boxplot() +ylim(0, 10000)

#city, employer and occupation

by(cont2$contb_receipt_amt, cont2$contbr_city, max)
